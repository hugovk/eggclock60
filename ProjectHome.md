## Description ##
Egg Clock is a simple timer for Symbian Series60 3rd/5th edition devices.
The timer value can be up to 100 minutes.

When the timer countdown reaches zero, the audio file selected by the user is played and the screen starts flashing, showing the indication of the extra time.


## Usage ##
All the actions can be executed from the menu of the application, but here's a short list of shortcuts:
  * press central key to start or stop the timer
  * press "c" key to reset the timer
  * press up/down to increase or decrease the volume of the notification

On touchscreen devices (5th edition phones such as Nokia 5800XM):
  * tap the screen once quickly to start or stop the timer
  * tap and hold the screen for about 1 second to reset the timer
  * use volume keys to adjust the volume


## Installation ##
If you get a certificate error when installing the application, it probably means that your phone does not accept self signed applications. You will need to go to the application manager on your phone and change the software installation setting from signed only to all.
